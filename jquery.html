                            <p>&nbsp; Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents
                                designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as
                                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

                                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render
                                the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page
                                semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

                                HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and
                                other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML
                                provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for
                                text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements
                                are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img and input
                                directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as p surround and provide
                                information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
                                Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the
                                content of the page.
                                HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which
                                affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and
                                layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML
                                and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit
                                presentational HTML since 1997.<br>

                            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the
                                presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a
                                cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

                                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout,
                                colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more
                                flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable
                                multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
                                file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as
                                enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages
                                that share the file and its formatting.

                                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup
                                page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print,
                                by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile
                                devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a
                                mobile device.[4]

                                The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style
                                rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority
                                scheme is predictable.

                                The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet
                                media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998).
                                The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]

                                In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML,
                                plain XML, SVG, and XUL.<br>

                            <p>&nbsp; Sass (short for syntactically awesome style sheets) is a preprocessor scripting
                                language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript
                                is the scripting language itself.

                                Sass consists of two syntaxes. The original syntax, called "the indented syntax," uses a
                                syntax similar to Haml.[2] It uses indentation to separate code blocks and newline
                                characters to separate rules. The newer syntax, "SCSS" (Sassy CSS), uses block
                                formatting like that of CSS. It uses braces to denote code blocks and semicolons to
                                separate rules within a block. The indented syntax and SCSS files are traditionally
                                given the extensions .sass and .scss, respectively.

                                CSS3 consists of a series of selectors and pseudo-selectors that group rules that apply
                                to them. Sass (in the larger context of both syntaxes) extends CSS by providing several
                                mechanisms available in more traditional programming languages, particularly
                                object-oriented languages, but that are not available to CSS3 itself. When SassScript is
                                interpreted, it creates blocks of CSS rules for various selectors as defined by the Sass
                                file. The Sass interpreter translates SassScript into CSS. Alternatively, Sass can
                                monitor the .sass or .scss file and translate it to an output .css file whenever the
                                .sass or .scss file is saved.[3]

                                The indented syntax is a metalanguage. SCSS is a nested metalanguage, as valid CSS is
                                valid SCSS with the same semantics.

                                SassScript provides the following mechanisms: variables, nesting, mixins, and selector
                                inheritance.[2]<br>

                            <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
                                conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[7] JavaScript is high-level, often
                                just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing,
                                prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

                                Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide
                                Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web
                                applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,[9] and
                                all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

                                As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and
                                imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
                                working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the
                                Document Object Model (DOM). However, the language itself does not include any
                                input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host
                                environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.

                                JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded
                                in some servers, usually via Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of
                                applications created with frameworks such as Electron and Cordova.

                                Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name,
                                syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ
                                greatly in design.<br>

                                to ensure the interoperability of Web pages across different Web browsers.[2] ECMAScript
                                is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly
                                being used for writing server applications and services using Node.js.

                                jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and
                                manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax.[3] It is free,
                                open-source software using the permissive MIT License.[4] As of May 2019, jQuery is used
                                by 73% of the 10 million most popular websites.[5] Web analysis indicates that it is the
                                most widely deployed JavaScript library by a large margin, having at least 3 to 4 times
                                more usage than any other JavaScript library.[5][6]

                                jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM
                                elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also
                                provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript
                                library. This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and
                                animation, advanced effects and high-level, themeable widgets. The modular approach to
                                the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web
                                applications.

                                The set of jQuery core features—DOM element selections, traversal and
                                manipulation—enabled by its selector engine (named "Sizzle" from v1.3), created a new
                                "programming style", fusing algorithms and DOM data structures. This style influenced
                                the architecture of other JavaScript frameworks like YUI v3 and Dojo, later stimulating
                                the creation of the standard Selectors API.[7] Later, this style has been enhanced with
                                a deeper algorithm-data fusion in an heir of jQuery, the D3.js framework.<br>

                                from the same team that built AngularJS.<br>

                            <p>&nbsp; Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to web design that makes web pages
                                render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. Recent work also
                                considers the viewer proximity as part of the viewing context as an extension for
                                RWD.[1] Content, design and performance are necessary across all devices to ensure
                                usability and satisfaction.[2][3][4][5]

                                A site designed with RWD[2][6] adapts the layout to the viewing environment by using
                                fluid, proportion-based grids,[7][8] flexible images,[9][10][11] and CSS3 media
                                queries,[4][12][13] an extension of the @media rule, in the following ways:[14]

                                The fluid grid concept calls for page element sizing to be in relative units like
                                percentages, rather than absolute units like pixels or points.[8]
                                Flexible images are also sized in relative units, so as to prevent them from displaying
                                outside their containing element.[9]
                                Media queries allow the page to use different CSS style rules based on characteristics
                                of the device the site is being displayed on, e.g. width of the rendering surface
                                (browser window width or a physical display size).
                                Responsive layouts automatically adjust and adapt to any device screen size, whether it
                                is a desktop, a laptop, a tablet, or a mobile phone.
                                Responsive web design has become more important as the amount of mobile traffic
                                now[when?] accounts for more than half of total internet traffic.[15] Therefore, Google
                                announced Mobilegeddon in 2015, and started to boost the ratings of sites that are
                                mobile friendly if the search was made from a mobile device.[16] Responsive web design
                                is an example of user interface plasticity.[17]<br>
