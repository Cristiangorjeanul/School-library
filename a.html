                <h5>Astronomy (from Greek: ἀστρονομία) is a natural science that studies celestial objects and
                    phenomena. It uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry in order to explain their origin and
                    evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, and comets.
                    Relevant phenomena include supernova explosions, gamma ray bursts, quasars, blazars, pulsars, and
                    cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, astronomy studies everything that originates
                    outside Earth's atmosphere. Cosmology is a branch of astronomy. It studies the Universe as a
                    whole.

                    Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. The early civilizations in recorded history made
                    methodical observations of the night sky. These include the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians,
                    Chinese, Maya, and many ancient indigenous peoples of the Americas. In the past, astronomy included
                    disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy, and the making
                    of calendars. Nowadays, professional astronomy is often said to be the same as astrophysics.[2]

                    Professional astronomy is split into observational and theoretical branches. Observational astronomy
                    is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects. This data is then analyzed
                    using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of
                    computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. These two fields
                    complement each other. Theoretical astronomy seeks to explain observational results and observations
                    are used to confirm theoretical results.

            <dt>Lesson 2: Milky Way</dt>
            <dd>
                <h5>The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our
                    Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's
                    appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in
                    the night sky formed from stars that cannot be
                    individually distinguished by the naked eye.
                    The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin
                    via lactea, from the Greek γαλαξίας κύκλος
                    (galaxías kýklos, "milky circle").
                    From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because
                    its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within.
                    Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light
                    into individual stars with his telescope in 1610.
                    Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought
                    that the Milky Way contained all the stars in
                    the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate
                    between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis,
                    observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way
                    is just one of many galaxies.

            <dd>
                <h5>A star is an astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its
                    own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye
                    from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to
                    their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into
                    constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled
                    star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. The
                    observable Universe contains an estimated 1×1024 stars,[1][2] but most are invisible to the naked
                    eye from Earth, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way.

            <dt>Lesson 4: Planets</dt>
            <dd>
                <h5>A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be
                    rounded by its own gravity, is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and has cleared its
                    neighbouring region of planetesimals.

                    The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Apart
                    from Earth itself, five planets in the Solar System are often visible to the naked eye. These were
                    regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge
                    advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In
                    2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets
                    within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of
                    planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered
                    before 1950 remain "planets" under the current definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres,
                    Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first
                    trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community,
                    are no longer viewed as planets under the current definition of planet.

            <dt>Lesson 5: Comets</dt>
            <dd>
                A comet is an icy, small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to
                release gases, a process called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes
                also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon
                the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred meters to tens of kilometers across and
                are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15
                times Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch beyond one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright,
                a comet may be seen from Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons)
                across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.

            <dd>
                Asteroids are minor planets, especially of the inner Solar System. Larger asteroids have also been
                called planetoids. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the
                Sun that did not resolve into a disc in a telescope and was not observed to have characteristics of an
                active comet such as a tail. As minor planets in the outer Solar System were discovered that were found
                to have volatile-rich surfaces similar to comets, these came to be distinguished from the objects found
                in the main asteroid belt.

            <dt>Lesson 7: Natural satellites</dt>
            <dd>
                <h5>The natural satellite, or moon, is, in the most common usage, an astronomical body that orbits a
                    planet or
                    minor planet (or sometimes another small Solar System body).

                    In the Solar System, there are six planetary satellite systems containing 205 known natural
                    satellites.
                    Four IAU-listed dwarf planets are also known to have natural satellites: Pluto, Haumea, Makemake,
                    and
                    Eris.[1] As of September 2018, there are 334 other minor planets known to have moons.

            <dt>Lesson 8: Climate</dt>
            <dd>
                <h5>Climate is the long-term average of weather, typically averaged over a period of 30 years.[1][2]
                    Some of
                    the meteorological variables that are commonly measured are temperature, humidity, atmospheric
                    pressure,
                    wind, and precipitation. In a broader sense, climate is the state of the components of the climate
                    system, which includes the ocean and ice on Earth.[1] The climate of a location is affected by its
                    latitude, terrain, and altitude, as well as nearby water bodies and their currents.

                    More generally, the "climate" of a region is the general state of the climate system at that
                    location at
                    the current time.
